## What is Dojo?

Dojo is a free, open source platform for clubs, gyms, and coaching centres to manage everything in one place. Built to replace spreadsheets and disconnected tools, Dojo handles your members, classes, coaches, attendance, invoicing, and documents — with a member-facing portal for payments and communication.

Dojo is sport and activity agnostic. Whether you run a judo club, a dance school, a boxing gym, or a music centre, Dojo adapts to your needs.

## Getting Started

Dojo runs in Docker. You'll need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed. No `.env` file, migration command, or `createsuperuser` step needed — the container generates its own secret key, waits for the database, and migrates itself on first boot.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DojoUK/dojo.git
cd dojo

# Start the database and web server
docker compose up -d
```

Open [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) — with no organisation set up yet, you'll land straight on a setup wizard that creates your organisation and admin account together in one step. (Prefer to poke around with sample data first? Visit `/setup/?demo=1` instead for a one-click demo club.)

**Stopping Dojo:**

```bash
docker compose down
```

For a real domain, TLS, backups, and env var reference, see the [self-hosting guide](./SELF_HOSTING.md).

## Data & Privacy

Dojo processes member personal data, including medical information and, for staff, DBS/safeguarding numbers. Payment processing runs through **Stripe** (a sub-processor, US-based, GDPR-compliant via Standard Contractual Clauses) — no card details ever touch Dojo directly. See [PRIVACY.md](./PRIVACY.md) for lawful basis, retention periods, and the full processor list.
